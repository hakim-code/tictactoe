2D tictactoe by Alex Lee

This is the game done by Alex Lee in Youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQb3dE-y1S4&t=1668s.

This exercise i consider to myslef as an easy level of learning. Technically it does not require much time but as i am the who is not from Computer Science student,
i would say it ll be required 4 hours to be able to understand.

This simple game would work just only in one class. Under this class there are few classes. Certain parts already were highlighted so that can ease my learning process.

I wish you have a nice start in learning java with this exercise!
